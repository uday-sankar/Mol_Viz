# Mol_Viz
A python matplotlib based molecular visualization tool.

Visualization can be done either using matplotlib or Py3Dmol
Py3Dmol only works inside jupyternoteboook

Visualization works in internal coordinates as well as in cartesian coordinate, as long as a transformation to cartesian from internal is provided.

PS:This set of codes are not very seriously written and not veen well formatted. But a good basic code to expland and add more features
